      detailed_solution:"The genetic code is the set of rules that determines how information from a gene is translated into a protein. It consists of three-nucleotide sequences called codons, each of which codes for a specific amino acid. There are 20 common amino acids, and each amino acid is coded for by at least one codon.\n\nThe genetic code is characterized by the following properties:\n\n* It is **specific**, meaning that each codon codes for a specific amino acid.\n* It is **universal**, meaning that the same codon codes for the same amino acid in all organisms.\n* It is **non-overlapping**, meaning that each nucleotide is used only once in a codon.\n* It is **degenerate**, meaning that most amino acids are coded for by more than one codon.\n\n**Non-polarity** is not a characteristic of the genetic code. Non-polarity refers to the chemical nature of certain amino acids, not to the genetic code itself. Polar amino acids have charged side chains, while non-polar amino acids have uncharged side chains. The polarity of an amino acid affects its solubility and its interactions with other molecules.\n\n**Additional context:**\n\nThe genetic code was first deciphered by Marshall Nirenberg and Har Gobind Khorana in the 1960s. They used a technique called cell-free protein synthesis to determine which codons coded for which amino acids. The genetic code has since been found to be universal in all living organisms, with a few minor exceptions.",

      detailed_solution:"ibose and deoxyribose are both pentose sugars (having five carbon atoms) that form the backbone of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). The main difference between them lies in the presence or absence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the second carbon atom.\n\n* **Ribose:** Has a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the second carbon atom (2'-OH).\n* **Deoxyribose:** Lacks the hydroxyl group at the second carbon atom and instead has a hydrogen atom (-H) attached to it.\n\n**Why is the answer correct?**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between ribose and deoxyribose. The answer, \"Hydroxyl group at 2nd carbon,\" correctly identifies that the presence of a hydroxyl group at the second carbon atom is what distinguishes ribose from deoxyribose.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* Ribose is found in RNA (ribonucleic acid).\n* Deoxyribose is found in DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).\n* The absence of the hydroxyl group at the second carbon atom in deoxyribose makes DNA more stable and less prone to hydrolysis (chemical breakdown).\n* The hydroxyl group in ribose allows for the formation of secondary structures, such as hydrogen bonding and base pairing, which are crucial for the function of RNA.",

      detailed_solution:"The process of transferring genetic information from a polymer of nucleotides (DNA or RNA) to a polymer of amino acids (protein) is known as **translation**. This process is carried out by the ribosomes in the cytoplasm of cells.\n\n**The steps of translation are as follows:**\n\n1. **Initiation:** The ribosome binds to the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule at the start codon (AUG). A specific transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule carrying the amino acid methionine (Met) binds to the start codon.\n2. **Elongation:** As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, different tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids bind to their complementary codons on the mRNA. The amino acids are then linked together by peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain.\n3. **Termination:** Translation is terminated when a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered on the mRNA. The polypeptide chain is released from the ribosome and folding begins to form the functional protein.\n\nTherefore, translation is the process that converts the genetic information in nucleotides into the amino acid sequence of a protein."},
